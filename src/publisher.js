// state. Field symptom: ~18 'Keepalive timeout' errors against a single successful

// CONNACK-armed manager, and _cleanUp destroys the manager), yet nothing in the log could

  // own clock (worker-timers-worker set-timer.js). That Worker is created lazily, on the

  // the page's performance.now() does NOT advance while an Android device sleeps. A
  // session left open for seven hours therefore handed the Worker a "now" hours in the
  // past, every keepalive tick was already overdue, the Worker fired three back to back
  // and mqtt.js raised 'Keepalive timeout' in the same second as the CONNACK. Every
  // reconnect re-armed the manager against the same skew, and the Worker is a module
  // singleton, so neither reconnecting nor building a fresh Publisher could clear it —
  // only reloading the page did, which is exactly what the field report says.
