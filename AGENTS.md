# AGENTS.md — coredrive-rx contributor rules

Standalone companion app for [CoreScope](https://github.com/Kpa-clawbot/CoreScope). NOT governed by
CoreScope's AGENTS.md — this repo has its own conventions below.

## Stack & layout
- Vanilla JS (ES modules) + Vite. MQTT.js over WSS. Web Bluetooth, `navigator.geolocation`, IndexedDB.
- `src/` is split by responsibility: `transport` (BLE), `frames`/`meshpacket` (parsing), `gps`,
  `queue` (IndexedDB), `publisher` (MQTT), `names` (resolve), `config` (runtime config), `app` (wiring/UI).
- Tests live in `test/*.test.mjs`, run with `node --test` (`npm test`). Add a test with every logic change.

## Configuration (runtime, not build-time)
- All per-deployment values live in a runtime `config.json` (served next to `index.html`), loaded by
  `src/config.js` at startup. Shape: see `config.example.json`.
- Do NOT reintroduce `VITE_*`/`.env` for deployment config, and never hardcode hostnames, URLs, or
  credentials in source.
- Secrets live ONLY in the gitignored `config.json` — never commit them, never surface them in the UI.

## Data-integrity invariant (do not weaken)
- Record only what the companion heard **itself and directly**: a 0-hop advert's full pubkey, or
  `path[last]` (the last forwarder) for FLOOD routes. Discard upstream hops. Require ≥2-byte path-hash.
- The MQTT payload shape is a contract with CoreScope's ingestor (`docs/client-rx-coverage.md` in the
  CoreScope repo). Changing it is a breaking change → major version bump.

## Workflow
- Semantic versioning in `package.json`. Tag each release `git tag vX.Y.Z` and `git push --tags`.
  patch = fix/tweak, minor = backward-compatible feature, major = breaking (e.g. payload contract).
- Every release tag MUST have a "What's New" body, written as `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` in the SAME
  commit as the version bump. One file, one release: a `# CoreDrive RX vX.Y.Z` heading, a one-line
  summary, a "What's new" bullet list (user-facing changes), and "Upgrade notes" (SW cache bump, any
  data/config migration). So anyone reading the tag sees what changed without diffing.
- Notes are CUMULATIVE, and that is now mechanical rather than remembered:
  `scripts/release-notes.mjs <tag>` concatenates every release file from that tag downwards, newest
  first, and `.github/workflows/release.yml` publishes the result as the body. A tag whose file is
  missing FAILS the release job instead of shipping a changelog link. This rule was a human
  convention for nine tags in a row and was missed on every one of them, which left v1.5.0 as the
  last release anyone could read while region discovery landed unannounced.
- To change a published body, edit the file under `docs/releases/` and re-post it:
  `node scripts/release-notes.mjs vX.Y.Z | gh release edit vX.Y.Z --repo efiten/coredrive-rx --notes-file -`.
- Commit AND push every change, with a descriptive message. Keep GitHub mirrored.
- PWA cache discipline: the service worker is network-first; `index.html`, `sw.js`, `manifest`, and
  `config.json` must be served `no-cache`; `/assets/` is immutable.
- Web Bluetooth needs a secure context — test over HTTPS or `localhost`.
